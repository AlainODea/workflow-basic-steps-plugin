<div>
Sets one or more environment variables within a block.
These are available to any external processes spawned within that scope.
For example:
<p><pre>
node {
  withEnv(['MYTOOL_HOME=/usr/local/mytool']) {
    sh '$MYTOOL_HOME/bin/start'
  }
}
</pre>
<p>(Note that here we are using single quotes in Groovy, so the variable expansion is being done by the Bourne shell, not Jenkins.)
<p>From Groovy code inside the block, the value is also accessible as <code>env.VARNAME</code>.
You can write to this property rather than using the <code>withEnv</code> step,
though any changes are global to the workflow build so should not include node-specific content such as file paths:
<p><pre>
env.MYTOOL_VERSION = '1.33'
node {
  sh '/usr/local/mytool-$MYTOOL_VERSION/bin/start'
}
</pre>
<p>A set of environment variables are made available to all Jenkins projects, including workflows.
The following is a general list of variables (by name) that are available;
see the notes below the list for Workflow-specific details.

<p>
    <iframe src="${rootURL}/env-vars.html" width="100%"></iframe>
</p>

The following variables are currently unavailable inside a workflow script:
<ul>
    <li><code>EXECUTOR_NUMBER</code></li>
    <li><code>NODE_NAME</code></li>
    <li><code>NODE_LABELS</code></li>
    <li><code>WORKSPACE</code></li>
    <li>SCM-specific variables such as <code>SVN_REVISION</code><li>
</ul>
As an example of loading variable values from Groovy:
<p><pre>
mail to: 'devops@acme.com',
    subject: "Job '${env.JOB_NAME}' (${env.BUILD_NUMBER}) is waiting for input",
    body: "Please go to ${env.BUILD_URL} and verify the build"
</pre>
</div>
