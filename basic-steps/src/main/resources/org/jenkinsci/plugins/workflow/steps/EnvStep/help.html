<div>
Sets one or more environment variables within a block.
This is a more robust way of setting variables than setting values of <code>env.NAME</code>.
<p>A set of environment variables are made available to all Jenkins Job types, including Workflow Jobs.
The following is a general list of variables (by name) that are available to all Job types. See the notes
below the list for Workflow specific details.

<p>
    <iframe src="${rootURL}/env-vars.html" width="100%"></iframe>
</p>

The following variables are currently unavailable inside a workflow script:
<ul>
    <li>EXECUTOR_NUMBER</li>
    <li>NODE_NAME</li>
    <li>NODE_LABELS</li>
    <li>WORKSPACE</li>
</ul>

<h4>Using Environment Variables</h4>

Environment variables are injected into scripts through a variable named "<strong>env</strong>". This variable,
like any other variable, can be used in the general flow of the script, or in variable substitutions e.g. when
constructing email content when using the <code>mail</code> step:

<p/>
<pre>
    mail (to: 'devops@acme.com',
        subject: "Job '${env.JOB_NAME}' (${env.BUILD_NUMBER}) is waiting for input",
        body: "Please go to ${env.BUILD_URL} and verify the build");
</pre>
