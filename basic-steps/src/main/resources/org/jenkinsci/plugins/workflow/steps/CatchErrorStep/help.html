    If the body throws an exception, mark the build as a failure, but nonetheless
    continue to execute the workflow from the statement following the <code>catchError</code> step.
    This is <em>only</em> necessary when using certain post-build actions (notifiers) defined originally for freestyle projects.
    For all other cases, use plain <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>(-<code>finally</code>) blocks.
    See <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/basic-steps/CORE-STEPS.md#interacting-with-build-status" target="_blank">this document</a> for details.
